Testing:
- PulseAudio input.

In progress:

Todo:
- Highlight mouse clicks (optional) [https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr/issues/10]
- Play start/stop sound (optional). [https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr/issues/26]
- Command-line options for recording + skipping pages + systray.
- Move SHM from GLFrameGrabber to GLInject.
- Multiple audio inputs.
- JACK support.
- X11Input should track resolution changes.
- Input + output profiles.

Wishlist:
- Improve interface for small screens.
- Check disk space (Muxer).
- FPS counter of GLInject (overlay + option to record?)
- Built-in re-encoding after recording
- clean up Global.h
- QuickLZ-based codec. (-> QuickLZ beta?)
- Better support for multiple GLInject windows.
- Easier GLInject application selection (as an alternative to entering the command).
- Timelapse recording, i.e. recording at a slow speed but playing it back faster (without sound obviously).
- maybe rewrite YUVConverter in assembly instead of using GCC vector extensions
- Planar sample/pixel formats for inputs (source/sink).
- Keep encoders completely inside the muxer.
- Multiple synchronization methods.
- Multiple audio streams (output).

Not sure yet:
- Fixed cursor position when using 'follow cursor'?
- skip microphone startup click?
- redesigned interface? (https://github.com/swick/glc2/issues/1)
- equalizer?
- if possible, force fixed size on OpenGL applications? (optional of course)
