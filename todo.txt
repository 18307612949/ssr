Todo:

Wishlist:
- PulseAudio input
- Fixed cursor position when using 'follow cursor'
- Built-in re-encoding after recording
- Audio latency correction.
- Separate file for each clip.
- clean up StdAfx.h
- move codec installation tests to MainWindow, not static
- Show codec/container support matrix somewhere?
- QuickLZ-based codec. (-> QuickLZ beta?)
- Better support for multiple GLInject windows.
- Easier GLInject application selection (as an alternative to entering the command).
- Timelapse recording, i.e. recording at a slow speed but playing it back faster (without sound obviously).
- Show preview image and sound level during recording.
- Force fixed fps and/or size on OpenGL applications. Also, different frame rate strategies.
- maybe rewrite YUVConverter in assembly instead of using GCC vector extensions
- optionally show rectangle during recording
- tray icon
- play start/stop sound
- skip microphone startup click?
- redesigned interface (https://github.com/swick/glc2/issues/1)
- equalizer?
